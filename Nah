List of events:

Ship Raid: NPC ships will randomly start attacking your boat. Defeat them for fragment rewards and possibly a random fruit.

Re-implemented the Server Browser (without a Bounty filter, until we figure out the best way to patch bounty exploiters)
Revamped the animations of a few weapons (more coming soon), Bisento being an example.
Added a damage counter for combos, which can be toggled in Settings.
Added a quest tracker along with a compass, which should help inexperienced players find recommended quests.
Added Advanced Raids, which must first be unlocked, and are harder to complete than regular Raids.
Also, Raids' difficulties will now scale with participants' levels.
Added ping compensation to stuns. Players with higher ping should have a better combat experience now.
Globally buffed the experience every Quest gives.
Added a new mob and quest to the First Sea (Impel Down New area), and adjusted the level requirements of some other quests.
In order to nerf aimbot, guns will now deal reduced damage to other players every consecutive hit, in the Second and Third sea only.
How it works:
The First hit will deal 100% damage.
The Second hit will deal 66%
Third and further hits will deal with 33%.
After a few seconds, the timer will be reset.
Note: These changes only apply when your opponent is moving. Guns will always deal full damage when the opponent is not moving.
This should allow legit players to continue using guns effectively. Also, Suspicious Kill now triggers more accurately.

Reworked the Mastery stat buff formula:
Instead of gaining 1 point every 3 mastery levels, you'll gain 1 point every 4 levels and a small % based on your Player Level (up to 10% of your Player Level at 600 Mastery).
Example: At Player Level 2300 and 500 Mastery, you should have 500/4 + 2300*(500/600)*0.1 = 316 extra points.
Basically, this just makes you gain more stat points from the mastery system.
Added Fan Art frames in the Café and Mansion (Third Sea).
Added a date restore option for people who were falsely banned. Also reduced the data punishment on future resets.
Currently testing a new text translation method, text may not be translated temporarily. This should allow us to support more languages soon, such as Thai.
