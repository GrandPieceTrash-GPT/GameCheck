Added a damage counter for combos, which can be toggled in Settings.

Added a new mob and quest to the First Sea (Impel Down New area), and adjusted the level requirements of some other quests.
In order to nerf aimbot, guns will now deal reduced damage to other players every consecutive hit, in the Second and Third sea only.
How it works:
The First hit will deal 100% damage.
The Second hit will deal 66%
Third and further hits will deal with 33%.
After a few seconds, the timer will be reset.
Note: These changes only apply when your opponent is moving. Guns will always deal full damage when the opponent is not moving.
This should allow legit players to continue using guns effectively. Also, Suspicious Kill now triggers more accurately.

Reworked the Mastery stat buff formula:
Instead of gaining 1 point every 3 mastery levels, you'll gain 1 point every 4 levels and a small % based on your Player Level (up to 10% of your Player Level at 600 Mastery).
Example: At Player Level 2300 and 500 Mastery, you should have 500/4 + 2300*(500/600)*0.1 = 316 extra points.
Basically, this just makes you gain more stat points from the mastery system.
